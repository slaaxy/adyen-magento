# Adyen Payment plugin for Magento
Use Adyen's plugin for Magento to offer frictionless payments online, in-app, and in-store.

## Magento 1 end of life (EOL)
Magento has officially announced that Magento 1 will reach end of life (EOL) on June 1, 2020. No quality fixes or security patches will be deployed for Magento Commerce 1 or Magento Open Source 1 after this date.

As a consequence, using Magento 1 after June 1, 2020 makes your business highly vulnerable to security breaches, and unable to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).

To prevent these significant risks to both your business and ours, Adyen will stop processing payments for all merchants using Magento 1 as of June 1, 2020.

## Integration
The plugin integrates card component(Secured Fields) using Adyen Checkout for all card payments. Local/redirect payment methods are integrated with DirectoryLookup and HPP. For Point Of Sale (POS) payments we use Terminal API using Cloud-based communication. Boleto, MultiBanco and SEPA are a direct API integration into Adyen.

## Requirements
The plugin supports the Magento Community (version 1.8 and higher) and Enterprise edition (version 1.13 and higher). 
For Magento 2.x please use the following plugin: [https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-magento2](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-magento2)

## Setup Cron
Make sure that your Magento cron is running every minute. We are using a cronjob to process the notifications, our webhook service. The cronjob will be executed every minute. It only executes the notifications that have been received at least 5 minutes ago. This is to ensure that Magento has created the order, and all save after events are executed. A handy tool to get insight into your cronjobs is AOE scheduler. You can download this tool through <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AOEpeople/Aoe_Scheduler/releases">GitHub</a>.

## Caching / Varnish configuration
In case you are using a caching layer such as Varnish, please exclude the following URL pattern from being cached
